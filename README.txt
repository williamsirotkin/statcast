This is an application modeled after statcast where mlb player data can be visualized by different metrics and their stats. 

To run the application from the home directory:

1) cd ./backend

2) Run ./backend.sh 

3) cd ../frontend

4) Run ./frontend.sh

5) Visit localhost:3000 for application (Backend runs on localhost:4000 but no need to visit there)

Enjoy!
